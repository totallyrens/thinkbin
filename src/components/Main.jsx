        <h1>Main Content</h1>
        <p>
          Ah yes, behold me—the main content, center-aligned and ego-inflated,
          basking in the pixel-perfect glory of symmetrical margins! While
          sidebars whisper sweet nothings from the shadows, I stand tall,
          unapologetically flaunting my 92% viewport width like it's a
          designer’s final form. I am the Beyoncé of the DOM, the toast of the
          main tag, wrapped in divs like royal robes, soaked in flexbox
          nepotism. I don’t scroll—I command attention. The user's eyes?
          Puppets. Their mouse? A loyal subject. I am the gravity well of
          content hierarchy. Bow, peasants, for I am CENTERED.
        </p>
      </div>
    </main>
